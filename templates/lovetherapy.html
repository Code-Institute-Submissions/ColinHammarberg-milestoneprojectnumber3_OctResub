      <p class="white-text center-align">
        Love Therapy is an application used and developed by (Improvement Therapy & Psychiatrist Centre). It was developed for old and new clients of the therapy centre and to offer them a more comfortable way of scheduling appointments, contacting their therapist, staying anonymous, having their bookings on a schedule and documenting about how they feel. 

        The therapy industry hasn't been digitized on a worldwide basis yet. Most centres are not even offering digital meetings to their clients, which has made it difficult for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

        The usual way of handling client bookings is to do it through email communication and that the client has to send the therapist/psychiatrist an email to inform them of a new session, especially government based support centres. 

        Love Therapy offers full anonymity and does not require any accurate personal details, which gives some clients a more trustworthy relationship. The clients are also offered digital meetings, which is done through the platform SPCE.
