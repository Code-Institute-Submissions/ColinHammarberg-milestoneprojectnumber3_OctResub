laskll # LOVE THERAPY
 
### The Love Therapy application was created for the clients of the Love Therapy center, which is being run by DR. Edward. The application helps the clients to get a better structure on their bookings, meetings, keeping contact with Dr. Edward and being able to search up different content stored in the database.


# UX
 
* As an everyday client I want to experience a User Friendly application that is easy to understand and take usage of.
* The visitor is the individual who is a client of LOVE THERAPY. The application helps the client to get a better structure. 
* They will experience an ordinary, but different kind of application page. Not too much focus on the design, but more focus on the actual data and functions.

# REASONS FOR DEVELOPMENT

### I (Colin Hammarberg) am developing/building this application for the therapist and the society circulating around it. Currently therapist and psychotrists centers usually offer a very limited and difficult structure for their clients. Especially in the smaller cities all around the world. I am one of those people who feel that the structure could improve a lot with the therapists and psychotrists. All communication, booking, feedback and content are today handled through email and a piece of physical paper. This application will help the clients of "Improvement Therapy & Psychiatrist Centre" to receive a better and functional structure. At least I will be using it with my therapist instead of emailing back and fourth all the time. 

# TECHNOLOGIES USED 
 
### HTML
* The project uses HTML to get the content visual. The developer has been using HTML in all visual pages.
 
### CSS
* The project uses CSS to design all pages. I have put a lot of energy on the design and still am. I prefer to use external CSS, instead of internal CSS to achive a "better" code.

### JavaScript
* The project uses Javascript. I have had minor difficulties with Javascript, but I think that so far it have turned our pretty well.

### jQuery 
* The project uses jQuery. I have added quite a lot of jQuery (but mostly the same code on all pages to receive an even functionality). 

### PYTHON
* The project uses Python to build the actual application and its functionalities.
 
### FRAMEWORK
* The project uses MaterializeCSS, to achive a very well functioning framework, responsiveness and helpful tools/classes/grids. 

### FLASK
* The project uses Flask framework.

### MONGODB
* The project uses Mongo Database to store data and also display data to the users/clients.
 
### LANGUAGES
* The project uses English as its standard language and an Lang=”en” attribute has also been implemented.

# WIREFRAMES

# FEATURES

### All of the pages have been created with a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Python etc. This is shown very clearly, due to that it is a flask and python application. Clients to Improvement Therapy & Psychiatrist Centre are able to book meetings, add comments to what they would like to talk about on the next meeting, visualize a schedule with a drop-down menu which shows their next meetings, contact the centre, search up important information about mental illness etc. 

## Existing Features

### Navigation bar 
<a href="" target="_blank"><img src="/documentation/Navigation-bar-1.png" alt="Book Bites mobile Screen"></a>
<a href="" target="_blank"><img src="/documentation/Navigation-bar-2.png" alt="Book Bites mobile Screen"></a>

- The navigation bar is featured on all pages, but in different ways. If a user has not yet created an account and is currently logged into his/hers account, some of the application's features are not visible. The navigation bar is responsive and includes links to the "Love Therapy" logo, Home/Landing page, Contact page, My Account page, Schedule Meetings page, View Meetings page, Diary page and Log Out function (which directly logs out the user). It is identical in each page to allow for smooth navigation throughout the whole application.
- This nav bar will allow the user to easily find him or herself all around the application. As does the mobile navigation slide out (which comes out from the right side when the user activates it by clicking the hamburger icon).

### Landing Page

- The landing page contains a navigation bar, a Gif with some cool effects, and about us section in between the Gifs and a footer section which contains more information about the application and its therapy centre/application.
- The landing page also contains a footer section in the bottom of the page.
