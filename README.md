nslaskll # LOVE THERAPY
 
### The Love Therapy application was created for the clients of the Love Therapy center, which is being run by DR. Edward. The application helps the clients to get a better structure on their bookings, meetings, keeping contact with Dr. Edward and being able to search up different content stored in the database.


# UX
 
* As an everyday client I want to experience a User Friendly application that is easy to understand and take usage of.
* The visitor is the individual who is a client of LOVE THERAPY. The application helps the client to get a better structure. 
* They will experience an ordinary, but different kind of application page. Not too much focus on the design, but more focus on the actual data and functions.

# REASONS FOR DEVELOPMENT

### I (Colin Hammarberg) am developing/building this application for the therapist and the society circulating around it. Currently therapist and psychotrists centers usually offer a very limited and difficult structure for their clients. Especially in the smaller cities all around the world. I am one of those people who feel that the structure could improve a lot with the therapists and psychotrists. All communication, booking, feedback and content are today handled through email and a piece of physical paper. This application will help the clients of "Improvement Therapy & Psychiatrist Centre" to receive a better and functional structure. At least I will be using it with my therapist instead of emailing back and fourth all the time.

# FEATURES

### All of the pages have been created with a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Python etc. This is shown very clearly, due to that it is a flask and python application. Clients to Improvement Therapy & Psychiatrist Centre are able to book meetings, add comments to what they would like to talk about on the next meeting, visualize a schedule with a drop-down menu which shows their next meetings, contact the centre, search up important information about mental illness etc.

- The navigation bar is featured on all pages, but in different ways. If a user has not yet created an account and is currently logged into his/hers account, some of the application's features are not visible. The navigation bar is responsive and includes links to the "Love Therapy" logo, Home/Landing page, Contact page, My Account page, Schedule Meetings page, View Meetings page, Diary page and Log Out function (which directly logs out the user). It is identical in each page to allow for smooth navigation throughout the whole application.
- This nav bar will allow the user to easily find him or herself all around the application. As does the mobile navigation slide out (which comes out from the right side when the user activates it by clicking the hamburger icon).

### Features left to implement

* In the future I would like to integrate SPCE (Digital meeting platform) onto the application and that the client automatically receives an account when creating an account on Love Therapy. It would be easier for the client to have digital meetings then.
* I would also like to implement a direct booking system which shows when there are available slots and that triggers an automatic text message and email which should be sent to the client when completing a booking.
