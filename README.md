# LOVE THERAPY
 
### The Love Therapy application was created for the clients of the Love Therapy center, which is being run by DR. Edward. The application helps the clients to get a better structure on their bookings, meetings, keeping contact with Dr. Edward and being able to search up different content stored in the database.


# UX
 
* As an everyday client I want to experience a User Friendly application that is easy to understand and take usage of.
* The visitor is the individual who is a client of LOVE THERAPY. The application helps the client to get a better structure. 
* They will experience an ordinary, but different kind of application page. Not too much focus on the design, but more focus on the actual data and functions.

# REASONS FOR DEVELOPMENT

### I (Colin Hammarberg) am developing/building this application for the therapist and the society circulating around it. Currently therapist and psychotrists centers usually offer a very limited and difficult structure for their clients. Especially in the smaller cities all around the world. I am one of those people who feel that the structure could improve a lot with the therapists and psychotrists.
